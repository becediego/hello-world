# hello-world
My first repository

I am Diego. I'm starting to learn python. My goal is to become a data scientist. I'm starting with python then i want to focus on R and then i would like to develop my communications skills in order to not only analyze the data but to communicate my findings effectively. Wheter it be visually or written. That's it for now. Wish me luck!
